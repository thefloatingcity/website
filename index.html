<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
  The Floating City is a Minecraft server where you can freely build in
  creative, but in an endless void world, and unable to fly.
</p>
<p>
  Unique mechancics like infinite fall and multiple worlds add to the fun,
  but the spirit of the server remains the same: enjoying pure building with a
  tight-knit group of friends.
