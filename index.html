<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
  The Floating City is a unique Minecraft server where you freely build in creative, but in a void world and unable to fly.
  Unique mechanics like infinite fall and multiple worlds add to the fun, but the core concept stays the same:
  enjoying pure <em>building</em> with a tight-knit group of friends. Sound interesting? Come join us! ;D
