<h1>The Lore of The Floating City</h1>

<p>In the beginning, there was nothing. It was a void. Then, the void exploded into existence.</p>
<p>(It was a void before, and it was a void after. The difference is that now the void <em>existed</em>. Don't ask me to elaborate on this. I will not, not because I don't want to, but because I don't know how.)</p>
<p>Pulled apart by differing constants and potentials of creation, the void was split into fragments. These fragments were the overworld, the nether, and the end.</p>
<p>Various spirits and watchers exist in these realms: sometimes they collaborate; most often they go their own way and leave each other to their respective domains. The world is mostly desolate, devoid of any form of life.</p>
<p>When players enter the void—how, I do not know—they cannot yet fully comprehend the true fragmentation of the void. To cope, they enter into a dream. This dream is of their own formation and shared between all other players in it.</p>
<p>As the players go on to exist in the dream for a longer time, they grow wise and begin to see the true form of the void and its different fragments. Most players, upon unlocking this realization, exit the shared dream and join the others in reality.</p>
<p>Over time, as more players grew wise, settlements of them formed. The founders of one of the larger settlements lovingly gave the void the name of The Floating City.</p>
<p>There are those, though, who willfully stay behind in the dream, forsaking reality. (Or, they just visit the dream from time to time). Those players are dubbed mad, and so the shared dream has been aptly named the madlands.</p>
